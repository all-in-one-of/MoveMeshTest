# MoveMeshTest
Here I'll try out different ideas about implementing the moving mesh algorithm

In this test I'll try out the idea of deleting completly the support structure after every refinement.
That works.
Now lets try if its ok to send just the nodes that each processor is missing instead of trying to create outline polygons
